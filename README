# Date Everything! Realizer — Offline Baked Tool

## Overview
This project is a **self-contained, offline web app** that helps track which characters in *Date Everything!* can be “Realized” based on your player stats (**S.P.E.C.S.**: Smarts, Poise, Empathy, Charm, Sass).

The app was created in a **trial-and-error, no-coding-experience way**, using **ChatGPT-5** to iteratively generate, debug, and refine the HTML/JavaScript until everything worked.  

The result is a **single HTML file** that requires no server, no uploads, and no internet connection.

## Features
- **Character classification**
  - **Eligible Now** → You meet all 5 requirements.
  - **Nearly There** → You’re not eligible yet, but all shortfalls ≤ 5.
  - **Realized** → Characters you’ve marked as realized (they don’t appear in other lists).
- **Stat entry** — Input your Smarts, Poise, Empathy, Charm, and Sass, clamped/rounded to 5-point steps (0–100).
- **Progress saving** — Uses browser `localStorage` to remember your stats and realized list between sessions.
- **Toggle Realized** — Mark/unmark characters with a single button.
- **Responsive UI** — Works on desktop or mobile browsers.
- **Offline-only** — No network requests, no dependencies.

## How it works
- The HTML contains:
  - **CSS** for layout and styling.  
  - **JavaScript** that handles parsing, classification, and rendering.  
  - **Base64 data URIs** that embed all the portraits and background image directly.  
  - A baked JSON payload of characters + requirements.  
- When the file loads:
  - It populates the global `CHARACTERS` array with stat requirements and portrait URLs.  
  - Background image is set automatically.  
  - UI renders lists of characters based on your stats and realized set.  
- State is persisted in `localStorage` (safe, local to your browser).

## Usage
1. Download the HTML file.  
2. Open it in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).  
3. Enter your S.P.E.C.S. values.  
4. Click **Check** to classify characters.  
5. Use the **Realize/Unrealize** buttons to manage your realized list.  
6. Use **Reset** to clear all saved progress.

## Safety
- It’s a static HTML file — no executables, no hidden processes.  
- Works offline (`file://` protocol).  
- Makes **no external requests** — confirmed by inspection.  
- Data never leaves your computer.  
- If in doubt, you can open the HTML in any text editor to review all code.
